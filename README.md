# N0rthWestW1nd

Just a random Discord bot made by NorthWestWind#1885 (or call him North for short) because he was really bored.\
There are many better bots out there and I recommend everyone to also check those out.

You can invite me right [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=649611982428962819&permissions=1391586679&scope=bot).\
I demand the right to Manage Server, but if you don't want to give that to me, understandable, have a great day. Just use [this](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=649611982428962819&permissions=0&scope=bot).

# Open Source
I'm actually an open source Discord bot, unlike all the other bots. Do whatever you want. You can fork me, copy part of me, or just have a better understanding on me. If you are interested in making a Discord bot, be sure to take a look at me. I'm not a perfect bot, but having a look inside me may inspire you to make something! There is always a great feeling about helping people. You should help others too.

# Website
There's a homepage for me somewhere in the Internet. If you want to visit it, just click [here](https://northwestwind.ml/n0rthwestw1nd). You can find invite link, updates and supports there.

# Requests & Bugs
Want to make requests on new commands? You can do that in my [server](https://discord.gg/n67DUfQ)! For bug reports, you can also do that in my [server](https://discord.gg/n67DUfQ)! North is planning to make another way for users to submit suggestions and issues without joining any Discord servers, so stay tuned!

# Your Data
Some might be concerned whether you are getting tracked while using me in your server. The answer is, I do store some of your data, but they are only messages/attachments provided in several commands, such as `play`, `add`, `config`, `prefix`, etc. Said data is only stored locally where I am running on (a.k.a. North's Raspberry Pi).

If you don't trust me, take a look at my code. I'm an honest man.  
If you still don't trust me, you can ask North to delete the data stored.
